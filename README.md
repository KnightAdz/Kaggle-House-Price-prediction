# Kaggle-House-Price-prediction

House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques is a competition on Kaggle designed as an entry point for learning. Given data on 1460 house sales I train a model to predict sale prices of 1459 unlabeled house sales. General description and data are available on Kaggle at:

My current model is an ensemble of a random forest and a linear regression and is ranked in top 47% of entries.
